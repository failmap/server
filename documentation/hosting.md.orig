# Failmap server installation and maintenance

## Introduction

One of the core principles of the Failmap project is automation. This is reflected in the server configuration by having almost full configuration management. Setting up a hosted production instance of Failmap should be trivial and not require extensive knowledge of involved components (although it will help in troubleshooting).

The following knowledge is _required_ for basic installation:

- Basic Linux experience (using terminal/shell/ssh)

The following knowledge _may_ be needed for advanced maintenance or troubleshooting:

- Linux (Debian)
- Puppet
- Docker
- Nginx
- MySQL
- Python
- Django
- Redis
- Celery
- Git
- Consul

Additionally knowledge of the following related technologies is advised:

- Virtualization/Hosting
- DNS
- Networking

This project uses Puppet configuration management in a masterless configuration. This allows OS and applications on the host to be shaped in the correct configuration for this project.

## Installation

To install a full production Failmap stack the following is required:

- Dedicated bare-metal or virtual host with internet connectivity running either:
  - Debian 8
  - Debian 9
  - Ubuntu 18.04
- Recommended specs are: 1-2 CPU, 1-8GB RAM and 50-100GB disks.
- Terminal access to the host (SSH or via VM console, etc)
- Sudo/root permissions on the host
- Hostnames pointing to the server IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (replace `example.com` with the domain you intend to use for the website):
  - example.com (for the frontend, main site)
  - admin.example.com (for administrative backend)
  - grafana.example.com (optional, for viewing statistics)

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - example.com
  - admin.example.com
  - grafana.example.com
  - flower.example.com
  - failserver.example.com (optional)
=======
**Warning**: this installation assumes to run on a **clean and dedicated** host for a Failmap installation! It will **modify the OS** and take over things like firewalling, Docker, SSH, etc! **Do not run** on a server with existing other software or configuration as the actions performed cannot be undone easily/automatically!
>>>>>>> Set new standard for server configuration

With that said please follow these instructions to get a Failmap instance up and running:

1. Bring the server up and follow the basic OS (Ubuntu/Debian) installation procedure. Configure basic settings (language, keyboard, user) as seen fit and give it a hostname you like. It can be anything you want, but using the frontend hostname (`example.com`) as server hostname is not advised.

1. Login to the server via SSH or VM terminal as `root` user. Or as normal user and sudo to root `sudo su -`.

1. Run the following command to start installation:

        wget -q -O- https://gitlab.com/failmap/server/raw/master/install.sh | /bin/bash

1. You will be ask a few questions required for configuration. After this installation will commence.

1. Grab a Club-Mate (or 2) and wait until everything completes and the notice `All Done!` appears.

1. You Failmap server is now ready. You can visit it on the domain you configured, eg: https://example.com or visit the administrative backend at: https://admin.example.com.

## Upgrading

Failmap server configuration is split into a _base configuration_ (maintained by Internet Cleanup Foundation at https://gitlab.com/failmap/server/) and a _server configuration_ with customizations for a specific installation.

If new features or bugfixes are developed in the base configuration the server can be updated on demand using the following procedure:

1. Open a terminal (eg: SSH) on the server and become root user (`sudo su -`)

1. Run the following command:

        failmap-server-update-configuration

## Configuration (advanced)

An initial configuration file (the 'server configuration') is created during installation (see above) and is stored on the server on the path: `/opt/failmap/server/configuration/settings.yaml`

Aspects of the server can be customized in this file. All available settings and documentation can be found in this configuration file.

After the configuration file has changed the following commands have to be run to apply the new configuration:

        failmap-server-apply-configuration
