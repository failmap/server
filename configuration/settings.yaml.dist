# This is a template file, copy as `settings.yaml` to make it effective.
# This file allows to set configuration values which are used during deployments.
# Defaults can be found in `defaults.yaml` and per-host or per-environment settings can be
# made by creating/editing the respective file(s) in `per-host` or `per-environment`.
# If you only have one host/environment putting everything in here is fine as well.
